        <h1>Coming Up at the Lyman Hall Theater</h1>
        <p>February will be another banner month at the Lyman Hall
            Theatre with three performances of the Tony Award winning
            musical, <em>West Side Story</em> by the Broadway Touring Company.
            Tickets are going fast, so order yours today.
        </p>

        <p>Celebrate Valentine's Day with the Chamberlain Symphony and
            their special selection of classical music for lovers. Later that
            week, exercise your mind by attending the Charles Dickens classic,
            <em>The Mystery of Edwin Drood</em>. Can you solve Dickens'
            unfinished mystery?
        </p>

        <p>Jazz lovers have a lot to celebrate in February with a visit
            from the <em>Jazz Masters</em> on February 21st, and then on February
            24th, enjoy the music of The Duke with an <em>Ellington Tribute</em>
            performed by the Jazz Company of Kansas City.
        </p>

        <p>Pins, bottles, plates, and chairs are flying at the Chamberlain
            Civic Center in February. The <em>Taiwan Acrobats</em> return on
            February 2nd with another amazing performance. We close out the
            month with a visit from the <em>Madtown Jugglers</em> and their unique
            blend of comedy, juggling, and madness.
        </p>

        <p>Enjoy a classical brunch every Sunday in February with music
            provided by the <em>Carson Quartet</em>. Seating is limited, so please order
            your table in advance.

                        targetting specific dates, but also will add in content) (spoiler warning: it's for mobile users)
